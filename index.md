I am a Ph.D student in the Tri-Institutional Computational Biology and Medicine Program (Cornell University, Weill Cornell Medical School, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center). I am working in Dr. [Christina Leslie]'s lab. We develop novel computational methods to study biological systems from a data-driven perspective.

I am trained in both genomics and statistical learning. My research interests include both: understanding basic biology using computational approaches (Next Generation Sequencing data analysis, method development), and applying computational models to help improve medical care (drug response prediction).
