I am a Ph.D student in the Tri-Institutional Computational Biology and Medicine Program (Cornell University, Weill Cornell Medical School, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center). I am working in Dr. [Christina Leslie]'s lab. We develop novel computational methods to study biological systems from a data-driven perspective.
